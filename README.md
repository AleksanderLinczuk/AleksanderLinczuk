I work professionally as a civil engineer :building_construction:, however I'm constantly striving to enhance my Java skills and transition into a software developer role. I have acquired a strong knowledge base and continuously expand it.

Currently, I work on developing my very own application that allows tracking, optimizing, and designating new mountain hiking routes :walking:. </br>The goal is to let users record their hike waypoints easily and quickly, calculate distance, pace, store personal records and plan future trips without revisiting the same hiking spots. :smile:

The project provides an opportunity to enhance my current knowledge and gain fresh insights in various fields, including:
- ☕ Java
- 🍃 Spring Boot
- ⚙️ MySQL
- 🔗 Hibernate, JDBC
- 💻 Vaadin, JS, HTML, CSS
- :walking: Mountain hiking routes :smile:
